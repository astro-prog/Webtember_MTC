## **2. Components of a "Tech stack"**
A tech stack is the combination of all the technologies we use to build and run an entire application. Here, "stack" refers to the way these different technologies are "layered" on top of each other to create a complete application. It includes the following aspects:
- Programming languages (JavaScript, [Python](https://python.org), …)
- Frameworks and libraries ([React](https://react.dev), [Angular](https://angular.dev), …)
- Databases ([MySQL](https://mysql.com), [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org), [MongoDB](https://mongodb.com), …)
- Tools
    - Version control ([Git](https://git-scm.com), [GitHub](https://github.com), …)
    - Package managers ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com), [pip](https://pypi.org/), …)
    - Build tools and bundlers ([Vite](https://vite.dev), [Babel](https://babeljs.io), …)
- APIs
- etc…

The tech stack chosen for any given application can also be described using these components, each of which involve a combination of the technologies mentioned above.
1. Front-end a.k.a. Client-side

    Client-side refers to the code and tech that runs on the users' devices.

2. Back-end
